    # RSA timing side-channel (Marvin Attack) - no fix available yet
    # Risk assessment:
    # - Our RSA usage is for Always Encrypted CEK unwrapping (client-side only)
    # - Operations are local, not network-exposed to attackers
    # - The vulnerability requires attackers to observe timing over the network
    # - The sspi crate also uses rsa for Kerberos/NTLM authentication
    # Tracking: https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/390
